Turnings in History

Late Medeival Saeculum

Retreat from France (Third Turning, 1435–1459) was an 
era of dynastic decline and civil disorder. In 1435, not 
long after Joan of Arc’s execution, the English withdrew 
from Paris for the last time. In the 1440s, they were 
pushed out of France on all fronts. Thus ended the 
Hundred Years War. Meanwhile, the weak rule of young 
Henry VI eroded central authority in England. By the 
1450s, noble houses flouted the law, vied for power, and 
engaged in private wars with impunity.

The War of the Roses (Fourth Turning, 1459–1487) 
began with an irrevocable break between the ruling 
Houses of Lancaster and York. After a bloody civil war, 
Yorkist kings (Edward IV, Edward V, Richard III) mostly 
prevailed in reigns that were punctuated with invasions 
and rebellions. At Bosworth Field (in 1485), Henry 
Tudor defeated Richard III and crowned himself Henry 
VII, founder of a new royal dynasty. Two years later he 
defeated a pretender at the Battle of Stoke, which won 
him the enduring confidence of his subjects.

Tudor Saeculum

The Tudor Renaissance (First Turning, 1487–1517) was 
an era of political and social consolidation. To popular 
acclaim, King Henry VII crushed challenges to his new 
dynasty and strengthened royal writs and commissions. 
On this foundation of central authority, births rose, 
commerce thrived, and construction boomed. The new 
sumptuous worldliness was best reflected in the palaces 
of Cardinal Wolsely. The era closed in a mood of cultural 
sterility.

The Protestant Reformation (Second Turning, 1517–1542) 
began in Germany with Martin Luther’s famous protest 
and spread swiftly to England. The enthusiasm peaked 
(in the mid-1530s) with King Henry VIII’s break with 
the Papacy, William Tyndale’s Bible, popular reform 
movements, and Parliament’s confiscation of vast 
Church estates. It ended when reformers tired or (like 
Thomas Cromwell) were executed, and when foreign 
wars with Scotland and France diverted the popular 
imagination.

Intolerance and Martyrdom (Third Turning, 1542–1569) 
was an era of social fragmentation, civil rebellion, and 
deadly political intrigue. Through the reigns of Edward 
VI and Queen Mary, the throne tacked violently over 
the issue of religion. The economy careened in a boom-
bust cycle, with royal debasements fueling unprecedented 
inflation. When the era closed, early in the reign 
of Queen Elizabeth, a disillusioned nation looked anxiously 
at the future.

The Armada Crisis (Fourth Turning, 1569–1594) began 
when the powerful Duke of Norfolk was linked to a 
Spanish plot against the English throne, a discovery 
which galvanized newly-Protestant England against the 
global threat of the Catholic Hapsburgs. A crescendo of 
surrogate wars and privateering culminated in England’s 
miraculous victory over the Spanish Armada invasion 
(in 1588). The mood of emergency relaxed after the successful 
resistance of Holland and the breaking of Spanish 
control over France.

New World Saeculum

Merrie England (First Turning, 1594–1621) was an age of 
optimism and prosperity, full of dreams of empire yet 
tempered by a wariness of enemies abroad. For the arts, 
this was the true English Renaissance and for literature, 
the glorious “Age of Shakespeare.” After succeeding 
Elizabeth in 1601, James I encouraged learning, exploration, 
and trade. His elaborately polite relations with the 
Commons began to wear thin late in the second decade 
of his reign.

The Puritan Awakening (Second Turning, 1621–1649) 
began with Parliament’s “Great Protestation.” Upon the 
accession of James’ son, the reformist urge turned radical 
and gained popular momentum. Seeking religious exile, 
John Winthrop led a “saving remnant” of true believers 
to America. In England, this Puritan Enthusiasm led to 
the Long Parliament (in 1640), civil war, and the execution 
of Charles I (in 1649). In the new wilderness colonies, 
the experimental fervor receded, leaving isolated 
settlements seeking an enforceable moral orthodoxy.

Reaction and Restoration (Third Turning, 1649–1675) 
was an era of drift and fierce controversy over the ideals 
of the original New World immigrants. Disoriented by 
fast-shifting events (Cromwell’s Protectorate in the 
1650s, the Stuart Restoration in 1660, a war with 
Holland in which “New York” was captured in 1664), 
each colony fended for itself and cut its own deal with 
England. The era ended with the authority of colonial 
self-government ebbing—and worries about the future 
rising.

The colonial Glorious Revolution (Fourth Turning, 
1675–1704) began with civil upheavals and catastrophic 
Indian wars—soon followed by Parliamentary efforts to 
reassert direct royal control over the colonies. The ensuing 
resistance culminated in 1689 with colonial rebellions 
that were triggered by news of the Glorious 
Revolution in England on behalf of William of Orange. 
A further decade of war against Canadian New France 
ended with Britain’s global triumph, vigorous institutions 
of colonial self-rule, and a new era of peace with 
local native tribes.

Revolutionary Saeculum

The Augustan Age of Empire (First Turning, 1704–1727) 
witnessed the first confident flowering of provincial 
civilization with booming trade, rising living standards, 
recognizable (northern) urban centers, and massive 
(southern) imports of African slaves. Lauding social 
discipline, Americans took pride in the growing might 
of Britain’s empire. Socially, this was the periwigged 
apogee of colonial politesse; culturally, it was an age of 
credentials, wit, and Royal Society rationalism.

The Great Awakening (Second Turning, 1727–1746) 
began as a spiritual revival in the Connecticut Valley and 
reached an hysterical peak in the northern colonies (in 
1741) with the preachings of George Whitefield and the 
tracts of Jonathan Edwards. The enthusiasm split towns 
and colonial assemblies, shattered the “old light” establishment, 
and pitted young believers in “faith” against

elder defenders of “works.” After bursting polite conventions 
and lingering Old World social barriers, the enthusiasm 
receded during King George’s War.

French & Indian Wars (Third Turning, 1746–1773) was an 
era of unprecedented economic and geographic mobility. 
Swept into a final war against New France in the 
1750s, the colonists hardly celebrated Britain’s total victory 
(in 1760) before renewing thunderous debates over 
how to salvage civic virtue from growing debt, cynicism, 
and wildness. With colonial leadership at a low ebb, 
popular fears soon targeted the alleged corruption of 
the English Parliament and empire.

American Revolution (Fourth Turning, 1773–1794) began 
when Parliament’s response to the Boston Tea Party 
ignited a colonial tinderbox—leading directly to the first 
Continental Congress, the battle of Concord, and the 
Declaration of Independence. The war climaxed with the 
colonial triumph at Yorktown (in 1781). Seven years later, 
the new “states” ratified a nation-forging Constitution. 
The crisis mood eased once President Washington weathered 
the Jacobins, put down the Whiskey Rebels, and 
settled on a final treaty with England.

Civil War Saeculum

The Era of Good Feelings (First Turning, 1794–1822) 
witnessed what Joel Barlow called The Conquest of 
Canaan an era of epical social harmony and empire 
building. Vast new territories were mapped and settled. 
Canals, steamboats, and turnpikes pushed back the wilderness. 
Even a blundering war (of 1812) ended up unifying 
the nation. Civil disorder was rare—as was spiritual 
curiosity in an era (wrote Emerson) “able to produce not 
a book…or a thought worth noticing.”

The Transcendental Awakening (Second Turning, 
1822–1844) began with Charles Finney’s evangelicalism 
and Denmark Vesey’s slave revolt. Soon merging with 
Jacksonian populism, it peaked (in 1831) with Nat Turner’s 
Rebellion, the founding of shrill abolitionist societies, 
and the rise of splinter political parties. After spawning 
a floodtide of “romantic idealism”—including feminism, 
new prophetic religions, food fads, and utopian communes—
the mood gentrified in the early 1840s into a 
credo of self-help, moral uplift, and manifest destiny.

The Mexican War & Sectionalism (Third Turning, 
1844–1860) was an era of “almighty dollar” commercialism, 
western “gold fever,” Whitmanesque self-worship, 
and nativist slogans against Mexicans and Irish. Beneath 
trimming national leaders, rising tempers launched 
competing moral crusades. By the late 1850s—from 
Kansas to Harper’s Ferry, Dred Scott to the Underground 
Railroad—visions of the nation’s future were separating 
into two irreconcilable regional loyalties.

The Civil War (Fourth Turning, 1860–1865) began with a 
presidential election that many southerners interpreted 
as an invitation to secede. The attack on Fort Sumter 
triggered the most violent conflict ever fought on New 
World soil. The war reached its climax in the 
Emancipation Proclamation and Battle of Gettysburg 
(in 1863). Two years later, the Confederacy was beaten 
into bloody submission and Lincoln was assassinated—
a grim end to a crusade many had hoped would “trample 
out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.”

Great Power Saeculum

Reconstruction & Gilded Age (First Turning, 1865–1886) 
saw old crusaders pushed aside while, notes Van Wyck 



Brooks, war veterans who “might have been writers in 
the days of The Dial were seeking their fortunes in railroads, 
mines, and oil wells.” Savings rates climbed, mass 
production roared, mechanical and political “machines” 
hummed, real wages surged, and “middle-class” families 
prospered in an age of pragmatism that vaunted “truth’s 
cash value.”

The Third Great Awakening (Second Turning, 
1886–1908), began with the Haymarket Riot and the 
student missionary movement, rose with agrarian protest 
and labor violence, and climaxed in Bryan’s revivalist 
candidacy (in 1896). Gilded Age realism came under 
harsh attack from trust-blasting muckrakers, Billy 
Sunday evangelicals, “new woman” feminists, and chautauqua 
dreamers. After radicalizing and splitting the 
Progressive movement, the passion cooled when 
William Howard Taft succeeded Teddy Roosevelt in the 
White House.

World War I & Prohibition (Third Turning, 1908–1929) 
was an era of rapid technological change, egocentric 
celebrities, widening class divisions, crumbling trusts 
and unions, and expert—but weak—political leadership. 
Following World War I, the public immersed itself in 
moral crusades (League of Nations, Prohibition, Women 
Suffrage). By the ‘20s, a fun-filled financial boom was 
framed by pessimistic debates over drugs, sex, money, 
cynicism, violence, immigration, and the family.

The Great Depression & World War II (Fourth Turning, 
1929–1946) began suddenly with the Black Tuesday 
stock-market crash. After a three-year economic free fall, 
the Great Depression triggered the New Deal revolution, 
a vast expansion of government, and hopes for a 
renewal of national community. After Pearl Harbor, 
America planned, mobilized, and produced for war on 
a scale that made possible the massive D-Day invasion 
(in 1944). Two years later, the crisis mood eased with 
America’s surprisingly trouble-free demobilization.

Millennial Saeculum

The American High (First Turning, 1946–1964) witnessed 
America’s ascendancy as a global superpower. Social 
movements stalled. The middle class grew and prospered. 
Churches buttressed government. Huge peacetime 
defense budgets were uncontroversial. Mass tastes 
thrived atop a collectivist infrastructure of suburbs, 
interstates, and regulated communication. Declaring “an 
end to ideology,” respected authorities presided over a 
bland, modernist, and spirit-dead culture.

The Consciousness Revolution (Second Turning, 
1964–1984), which began with urban riots and campus 
fury, swelled alongside Vietnam war protests and a rebellious 
“counterculture.” It gave rise to feminist, environmental, 
and black power movements—and to a steep rise 
in violent crime and family breakup. After the fury peaked 
with Watergate (in 1974), passions turned inward toward 
New Age lifestyles and spiritual rebirth. The mood 
expired during Reagan’s upbeat reelection campaign, as 
onetime hippies reached their yuppie chrysalis.

The Long Boom & Culture Wars (Third Turning, 1984–
2008) opened with triumphant “Morning in America” 
individualism; drifted toward celebrity scandal and a 
stock market boom; experienced a brief moment of “war 
on terror” unity; and then ended with yet another 
equity bubble. People felt optimistic about their personal 
lives, but pessimistic about the country. They worried 
about rising violence and incivility, widening 
inequality, and the splitting of the national consensus 
into competing “values” camps.

The Global Financial Crisis (Fourth Turning, 2008-2029?) 
was recently catalyzed by the 2008 global financial meltdown—
leading to the most severe global economic 
downturn since the Great Depression—and by the historic 
Presidential election of that same year. With public 
trust continuing to ebb, the regeneracy phase of this 
crisis (in which civic purpose begins strengthen) still 
seems years away, and the crisis climax is well over a 
decade distant. Most likely, this Fourth Turning will 
come to an end in the late 2020s, just as the rising 
Homeland Generation is beginning to embark on 
careers.
