Contemporaneously, by a decree of her husband, she was known in England as Queen Mary, but did not like this name and signed her letters "Henriette R".Her Roman Catholicism made her unpopular in England, and also prohibited her from being crowned in a Church of England service; therefore she never had a coronation. She began to immerse herself in national affairs as civil war loomed on the horizon, and was compelled to seek refuge in France in 1644, following the birth of her youngest daughter, Henrietta, during the height of the First English Civil War.

Due to its popularity it was translated several times into English - Catherine Winkworth being one of the translators in the 19th century - and the hymn has appeared in most major hymnals.Neander wrote about 60 hymns and provided tunes for many of them. He is considered by many to be the first important German hymnist after the Reformation and is regarded as the outstanding hymn writer of the German Reformed Church.Joachim Neander was born in Bremen, the son of a Latin teacher.

He has historically been credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have strong claims to the discovery.During his lifetime, Priestley\'s considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of carbonated water, his writings on electricity, and his discovery of several "airs" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). However, Priestley\'s determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the chemical revolution eventually left him isolated within the scientific community.

Because of the structure of the cochlea and the basilar membrane, different frequencies of sound cause the maximum amplitudes of the waves to occur at different places on the basilar membrane along the coil of the cochlea. High frequencies cause more vibration at the base of the cochlea while low frequencies create more vibration at the apex.He concluded that his observations showed how different sound wave frequencies are locally dispersed before exciting different nerve fibers that lead from the cochlea to the brain.
