WHO has been collecting data on alcohol consumption and alcohol control policies from its Member States since 1996. The current survey instrument entitled \"Global Survey on Alcohol and Health\" includes three sections, namely alcohol policy, alcohol consumption, and surveillance. The information provided is essential for the preparation of the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health and regional publications, as well as for updating the Global Information Systems on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) and regional information systems, as requested by the World Health Assembly Resolution on Public health problems caused by harmful use of alcohol. </p>"

The measure of alcohol consumption was assessed using Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB), Form 90, Drinking Self–Monitoring Log (DSML), Lifetime Drinking (LDH), and various Quantity–Frequency (QF) measures. For the current analysis, each variable was binned into five categories on a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)."
