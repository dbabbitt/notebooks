    "I think it would be good to have 2 each: one with regular density, one with the weighted density. I think it makes sense to make them look as similar as we can (i.e. prepared in the same package) if we can manage that.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of technical issues;\n",
    "- Dave's graphs needed a log-log scale to show the correlation well (because the density varied a lot). Patrick, can yours do that, or do we need to do it differently for the two continents? I argued in the article that we're tracking rate of exponential growth, so I think it makes sense for deaths to be on a log-scale at least.\n",
    "- I think it's possible the base point is slightly different: one (Patrick) may be \"first hitting 5 deaths total\" and the other (Dave) may be \"first hitting 5 deaths in a day\". Again, I don't think it matters too much, but best to be clear.\n",
