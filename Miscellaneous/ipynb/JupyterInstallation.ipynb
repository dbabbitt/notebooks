    "I wrote [way more than you ever want to know](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) about these in a post last year, but the essential difference between the two is this:\n",

    "- *pip* installs **python** packages in **any environment**.\n",
    "- *conda* installs **any** package in **conda environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a Python installation that you're using, then the choice of which to use is easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you installed Python using Anaconda or Miniconda, then use ``conda`` to install Python packages. If conda tells you the package you want doesn't exist, then use pip (or try [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), which has more packages available than the default conda channel).\n",

    "- If you installed Python any other way (from source, using pyenv, virtualenv, etc.), then use ``pip`` to install Python packages\n",

    "It will always lead to problems in the long term, even if it seems to solve them in the short-term.\n",
    "For example, if ``pip install`` gives you a permission error, it likely means you're trying to install/update packages in a system python, such as ``/usr/bin/python``. Doing this can have bad consequences, as often the operating system itself depends on particular versions of packages within that Python installation.\n",
    "For day-to-day Python usage, you should isolate your packages from the system Python, using either [virtual environments](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) â€” I personally prefer conda for this, but I know many colleagues who prefer virtualenv."

    "As I mentioned, the fundamental issue is a mismatch between Jupyter's shell environment and compute kernel.\n",
    "So, could we massage kernel specifications such that they force the two to match?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps: for example, [this github issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/847) shows an approach to modifying shell variables as part of kernel startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, in your kernel directory, you can add a script ``kernel-startup.sh`` that looks something like this (and make sure you change the permissions so that it's executable):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# activate anaconda env\n",
    "source activate myenv\n",
    "\n",
    "# this is the critical part, and should be at the end of your script:\n",
    "exec python -m ipykernel $@\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your ``kernel.json`` file, modify the ``argv`` field to look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"argv\": [\n",
    "   \"/path/to/kernel-startup.sh\",\n",
    "   \"-f\",\n",
    "   \"{connection_file}\"\n",
    " ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do this, switching to the ``myenv`` kernel will automatically activate the ``myenv`` conda environment, which changes your ``$CONDA_PREFIX``, ``$PATH`` and other system variables such that ``!conda install XXX`` and ``!pip install XXX`` will work correctly. A similar approach could work for virtualenvs or other Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one tricky issue here: this approach will fail if your ``myenv`` environment does not have the ``ipykernel`` package installed, and probably also requires it to have a jupyter version compatible with that used to launch the notebook. So it's not a full solution to the problem by any means, but if Python kernels could be designed to do this sort of shell initialization by default, it would be far less confusing to users: ``!pip install`` and ``!conda install`` would simply work."

    "\n",
    "One source of installation confusion, even outside of Jupyter, is the fact that, depending on the nature of your system's aliases and ``$PATH`` variable, ``pip`` and ``python`` might point to different paths.\n",
    "In this case ``pip install`` will install packages to a path inaccessible to the ``python`` executable.\n",
    "For this reason, it is safer to use ``python -m pip install``, which explicitly specifies the desired Python version ([explicit is better than implicit](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), after all).\n",
