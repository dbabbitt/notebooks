                <p>The Britons are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They represent the English and the Anglo-Normans during the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages. They focus on foot archers. The Britons' unique unit is the Longbowman, from their historical use of the English Longbow in their campaigns. Longbowmen are archers with higher range than every other archer in the game, even outranging Castles and towers in later stages of the game. Their Castle Age unique technology Yeomen refers to the fact that the Britons heavily relied on archery, thus giving their foot archers even more range, as well as increasing their tower damage. The Britons were known for their small villages scattered across England, as well as their tactics of encroaching on enemies with strongholds, and thus get cheaper Town Centers. Known as skilled shepherds and heavily involved in the wool trade, British shepherds work faster. For a time in England, all sports but archery were banned on Sundays, thus the Britons also have faster Archery Ranges.</p>

                <p>The Byzantines (or Eastern Roman Empire ) are Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II. They are situated in the Balkan peninsula and Asia Minor, along the eastern seaboard of the Mediterranean in the modern countries such as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania. In the Attila the Hun campaign, they represent the Western Roman Empire. Only classified as a defensive civilization in-game, they are in practice a very versatile civilization, relying on a wide variety of units of all categories for both offense and defense.</p>
                <p>As the medieval stage of the Roman Empire they retain characteristics of their Rise of Rome Roman (Roman and Palmyran) counterparts and Persian neighbors, such as their unique unit, the Cataphract, a type of heavy cavalry that happened to also be present in the original game. Their Imperial Age unique technology is Logistica, referring to the Byzantines' strong military tactics which grants their Cataphracts trample damage to attack multiple enemies at once. The Byzantines had a head start over their European neighbors and arguably reached their zenith while the rest of Europe were in the Dark Age. As a result, they pay less to advance to the Imperial Age.</p>
                <p>Constantinople operated as the center of a trading network that extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. So the Byzantine Empire's economy was among the most advanced in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantines' economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. That is reflected upon in the game with the Byzantines having access to all economic (Lumber Camp, Mill, and Mining Camp) upgrades.</p>
                <p>The Byzantines were best known for having deflected many invasions implemented by barbarians, Slavs and Arabs, and the famed doubled walls that surrounded their capital of Constantinople almost stood for over a millennium until overran by Ottoman Turks. To reflect this achievement, the Byzantines attain a theme of a defensive civilization and have tougher buildings as the Age progresses. Due to carrying on many of the traditions of Rome such as their naval prowess and being the inventors of Greek fire, an ancient napalm rumored to be able to ignite even on water, their Fire Ship attack faster and their Castle Age unique technology is Greek Fire, granting Fire Ships +1 range. As a defensive civilization, they also get cheaper counter units and Town Watch for free. Being the bastion of Greek Orthodoxy, their Monks heal faster to keep with their defensive theme.</p>

                <p>The Celts are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry and siege weapons.</p>
                <p>Historically, they were a Central European civilization who dominated much of Europe, such as Southern Germany, Spain, France, and the British Isles. The Celts in the game are based on the Celts of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales in Western Europe, but they only speak Irish Gaelic. Their unique unit is the Woad Raider, a type of infantry who covers himself in paint made from the woad plant to make himself look more fearsome. Woad Raiders move very fast, allowing them to overcome the normal infantry weaknesses against archers and siege weapons. Their [[Imperial Age (Age of Empires II)]Imperial Age]] unique technology is Furor Celtica, which refers to the Celtic warrior tradition of channeling their emotions and anger and makes their siege weapons harder to kill. Being masters of guerilla warfare, Celtic infantry move faster. Because of their historical wood and metalworking, their Siege Workshops build faster, their Lumberjacks work faster, and their siege weapons fire faster. Like their neighbors the Britons, the Celts were historically skilled shepherds, and it is much easier for them to steal their enemies' Sheep.</p>
                <p>Their descendants are the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish nations. These three nations, alongside the English nation (descendants of the Britons), created a united kingdom: the British civilization that is featured in Age of Empires III.</p>

                <p>The Chinese are an East Asian civilization in Age of Empires II. They are based on the Tang and Song dynasties of medieval China, and they focus on archers.</p>
                <p>The aforementioned dynasties were best known for their unprecedented technological innovations and highly populated cities accommodating millions of people by the 1200s. To reflect this achievement and for being one of the civilizations that suffered the least during the Dark Ages, they start with extra Villagers and their Town Centers support a higher population. Although they have fewer resources to compensate, allied Farms produce extra food (which reflects on the importance of rice agriculture in China). The unique unit of the Chinese is the Chu Ko Nu, a foot archer wielding the eponymous semi-automatic crossbow invented by the Chinese that would load a new bolt simultaneously as soon as the last one was fired. Chu Ko Nu fire multiple arrows at once and, if employed en masse, they can wreak havoc on infantry and even cavalry.</p>
                <p>Due to game balance reasons, the Chinese lack access to many of the technologies they invented, such as the Hand Cannoneer, Bombard Cannon, and Block Printing (the earliest record of a written formula for gunpowder appears in the 11th century Song dynasty text, Wujing Zongyao, the Heilongjiang Hand Cannon is widely considered the earlier surviving firearm, and the Block Printing technology in Age of Empires II even tributes the Chinese by name). Their unique technology, Rocketry, reflects their advanced gunpowder technology and boosts their Chu Ko Nu and Scorpions (by adding +2 and +4 attack respectively) to offer some limited compensation. The Chinese have a long history of using Demolition Ships in naval battles, and as such their Demolition Ships have 50% more hit points which allows them to reach their targets easier. Finally, the Chinese research all technologies more cheaply than any other civilization due to being one of the most advanced civilizations during the time frame of Age of Empires II.</p>

                <p>The Franks (now known as the French ) are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on cavalry.</p>
                <p>The Franks conquered and inhabited modern day France, which was previously known as Gaul. They are primarily an offensive civilization, although they possess a few defensive perks as well. Their unique unit is the Throwing Axeman, which deals melee damage at range. Throwing axes were more popular than bows in the densely forested parts of northern Europe where the Franks came from, and they even take their name from their throwing axe, the Francisca. Their Castle Age unique technology, Bearded Axe, reflect this by giving their Throwing Axemen more range. The Frankish King Charlemagne started the tradition of using armored cavalry who became known as knights, and Frankish Knights fight valiantly with more HP and greater Line of Sight. This tradition also spawned the concept of Chivalry (codes of knights), represented by the technology of the same name which boosts their Stables' working speed. Castles dot France, and the Franks get cheaper Castles to better emulate this. Finally, no Castle with a knight as its lord is complete without peasant labor, and thus, Frankish Farms upgrade for free and their Foragers work faster.</p>

                <p>The Goths are a Central European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry.</p>
                <p>The Goths were a collection of Eastern Germanic tribes that constantly warred with the Roman Empire during its later years, known for bringing Rome to its knees and traveling all over Europe, bringing devastation with them. Following the fall of the Empire, the Goths divided into the Ostrogoths (East Goths) who settled in Italy, and the Visigoths (West Goths) who settled in the region that would later become Portugal and Spain. The leaders of the Goths and their Age of Empires II equivalents were the Huskarls, the Gothic unique unit.</p>
                <p>As the Goths were known for their raiding prowess, the medium infantry Huskarls have high pierce armor and shrug off damage from fortifications. This also makes them very powerful against archers, and they also move quick enough to chase them down. The Goths were known as flexible nomads with mostly nonexistent formal government, so their first unique technology Anarchy allows their leaders, the Huskarls, to be trained at the Barracks like normal infantry, as early as the Castle Age.</p>
                <p>Their second unique technology Perfusion allows them to train infantry extremely fast. As the Goths were known for being able to mass soldiers very quickly, they are able to spam more units already available to all civilizations, thanks to their infantry costing less as they advance to Feudal Age and their Barracks naturally working faster. As raiders, Gothic infantry get extra attack bonus against buildings. Being nomads gave them other distinct advantage: their Villagers can hunt bigger game effectively and carry more meat. Finally, the Goths get a higher population limit to reflect their ability to field armies quickly.</p>
                <p>They are one of the ancestors of the Spanish and Portuguese civilizations. Hence, this is most likely why the Goths have access to gunpowder units such as Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons since both the Portuguese and the Spanish used gunpowder in warfare to expand their empires (although this can also be for gameplay balance purposes since the Goths have a lackluster Siege and Archery unit line).</p>

                <p>The Japanese are an East Asian civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry.</p>
                <p>The Japanese are an infantry-based civilization, with their infantry possessing the fastest attack speed in the game. They are the descendants of the Yamato civilization, which inhabited the same island. The Japanese civilization is based on Feudal Japan which was dominated by the powerful regional families (daimyō) and the military rule of warlords (shōgun) from 1185 to 1868. The Samurai were the elite warrior class in Japanese society and required dozens of years of training. The Samurai were armed with a Katana, an extra-sharp, thin bladed longsword, a Wakizashi, a shorter version of the Katana, and sometimes a Tantō. These soldiers served the lord and fought for them based on the strict Bushido honor code. To reflect their high rank and prestige of the Japanese warrior class and their association with the ninja, a covert agent, Japanese infantry attack faster.</p>
                <p>Japan is an island nation sea-reliant for most of its history, and as a result, the Japanese have extensive knowledge in maritime economy and warfare. To represent this, their Fishing Ships have double hit points and work more efficiently when advancing through the Ages, and the Japanese team's Galley line have a longer Line of Sight. Japan also possesses a number of volcanoes which create fertile lands for cultivation and ores for mining. To reflect this, the Japanese build Mills, Lumber Camps, and Mining Camps at a cheaper cost.</p>
                <p>Throughout its medieval history, Japan was in constant conflicts of clan lords who constructed a large number of fortifications; each had many arrowslits (or yasama) to repel attackers. This is represented by the technology, Yasama, which increases the number of arrows shot by towers. Also, during Sengoku Jidai (or the Warring States period), the Japanese came into contact with the Portuguese and the Dutch, with whom the Japanese traded goods for firearms and modern siege technology. This is reflected by Kataparuto ("catapult" written in katakana to represent the European origin) that allows Trebuchets to pack, unpack, and fire faster.</p>

                <p>The Mongols are an East Asian civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on mounted archers.</p>
                <p>The Mongols were a collection of nomadic tribes from the steppes of Central Asia and Siberia. They were fierce warriors who are known for establishing the largest contiguous overland empire in human history. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Mongol clans became united under Temujin who later became known as Genghis Khan following a campaign of foreign conquest of more developed and technologically advanced civilizations across East Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. At its height, their empire stretched from Korea across Asia and into European Russia to the Baltic Sea coast. They held most of Asia Minor, modern Iraq, modern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tibet, parts of India, parts of Burma, all of China, and parts of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Although greatly outnumbered in many key battles, the Mongols utilized a variety of guerilla warfare tactics involving highly skilled cavalry archers whose long range and accuracy provided by the unprecedented Mongol recurve bow gave them a great advantage on the battlefield. Much of the army consisted of light cavalry which were extremely light troops compared to those of other armies. This allowed them to execute tactics and maneuvers that would otherwise have been impractical. Having this mobility made it possible to send them on successful scouting missions, gathering intelligence about routes and terrain suited to the preferred combat tactics of the Mongols. This is reflected by their civilization bonuses which benefit their cavalry archers and Light Cavalry, team bonus which increases the Line of Sight of Light Cavalry, and their unique technology.</p>

                <p>The Persians are a Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on cavalry.</p>
                <p>The Persians are based on the large number of Persian dynasties that existed throughout the Middle Ages. Although their design and description were largely inspired by the Sasanian Empire, they are supposed to represent all Persian factions that existed during the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>They were best known for their rivalry with the Roman Empire and gradual adoption of Islam following the Arab invasions. They would grow to become a major hub and center of the Islamic world, contributing much to Islamic art and culture. Like their predecessor in the original game, the Persians specialize in cavalry and navy.</p>
                <p>Since BC, the region of Persia has been known as the place where various large empires like Parthia and Sassanid once stood. In addition, the region of Persia was also part of international trade routes between India, Far East, and the Middle East. This is reflected by two of their bonuses: They start the game with more food and wood, and their Town Centers possess higher HP and working speed. To ensure the safety of traveling ships in the Persian Gulf, the ruling empires stationed their military (including naval vessels) in the region. Therefore, Persian Docks also possess higher HP and work faster.</p>
                <p>The Persians were known to employ powerful armored cavalry on the battlefield. This is reflected by their virtually complete Stable. The borders of the Sassanian Empire were often raided by various nomadic tribesmen; by Arabs to the south and by Central Asians to the north and east. Using neighboring vassal states (e. g. the Lakhmid Kingdom of Arab) as a buffer zone was one of the methods used by the Sassanian to stop these raids. To reflect this, the Persians have a team bonus which increases the attack of their Knights against archers.</p>
                <p>During the Sassanian and Timurid era, war elephants were part of the Persian military force. This is reflected by their unique unit, the War Elephant. The riders of elephants were known as Mahouts, and this name is used as one of the Persians unique technologies, which increases the War Elephants' movement speed. The Sassanian Empire was also known to build complex fortification lines along their borders. Thus, their other unique technology, Boiling Oil, provides Castles with additional attack against rams.</p>

                <p>The Saracens are a Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on cavalry and ships.</p>
                <p>The term "Saracen" has a disputed etymology, and historically has meant different things; most relevant here is the medieval European exonym for Arabs. The first significant Saracen kingdoms were the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, which were proxy states of the Byzantine and Persian Empires, respectively. In the 7th century, starting with the rise of Islam and the campaigns of the Rashidun Caliphate, the Saracens became a dominant power in Western Asia and North Africa.</p>
                <p>Under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, the Saracens expanded their territory immensely. In that time, they presided over the largest empire ever to exist - larger than Rome, and unmatched until the Mongol invasions. In Saladin's campaign, they represent medieval Egypt, specifically the Ayyubid Sultanate. Their in-game design thus seems like an amalgamation of various Arab groups from different time periods.</p>
                <p>Situated in the crossroads of the world, they were most notable for initiating the rise of Islam and starting the Arab conquests. To reflect their achievement as a powerful desert civilization and for founding one of the major religions of the world, their unique technologies benefit their Monks and camel units. They also gave importance to their navy to protect their shores from Byzantine assault, which is reflected with their naval bonus which gives their Galleys a 20% faster attack and also gives them the best Transport Ships with more hit points and a bigger carry capacity.</p>
                <p>The Saracens were also active traders being located at the crossroads of the world. As a result, their Markets are cheaper, and their commodity trading fee is only 5% as opposed to 30% (the standard fee for all other civilizations).</p>

                <p>The Turks are a Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on gunpowder units.</p>
                <p>The Turks originated from Central Asia and are based on the Seljuk Empire, the Sultanate of Rum (shown in the Manzikert scenario) and the Ottoman Empire. They were best known for winning many battles in the Crusades as well as successfully besieging Constantinople which ended European foothold of the Silk Road and contact with the Orient. The Turks were also highly involved in the sciences and mathematics especially in the area of alchemy that would later form the backbone of modern chemistry. Being an Islamic civilization, they were notable for transmitting this knowledge to the west. Therefore, Turks mine gold faster and get Chemistry for free.</p>
                <p>They also used gunpowder quite effectively, becoming the first "gunpowder empire", having received it from their control of the Silk Road. Therefore, many of their unique traits benefit their gunpowder units which have greater range, are created faster, and cost less. Additionally, their unique unit is also a gunpowder unit.</p>

                <p>The Vikings are a Central European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry and navy.</p>
                <p>The Vikings were best known for being advent sailors and for establishing settlements and colonies in the North Atlantic in Greenland and Newfoundland, hundreds of years before the arrivals of Southern and Western European explorers. They were also known for bringing fear among several European communities since they would raid small villages unexpectedly. As a result, their navy and infantry are among the finest in the game and have a unique unit in both branches.</p>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, spread through 19th and 20th centuries' popular culture, the Vikings did not actually wear spiked or horned helmets, but they refrained from trimming their head and facial hair to give the look of a big, scary, and hairy beast. This is reflected by their unique unit, the Berserk, and their unique technology that benefits them. Furthermore, their infantry, including the Berserk, has more health.</p>
                <p>The Vikings also excelled at naval warfare and tactics, and mastered the art of various types of sailing. Therefore, their other unique unit is the Longboat which is a well-constructed slim boat that gracefully shoots through the water and fires volleys of arrows. To further emphasize their ability as fine shipbuilders, all Viking ships cost fewer resources, and their team bonus allows Docks to be built for less wood as well.</p>

                <p>The Aztecs are a Native American civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They focus on infantry and Monks. Their unique unit is the Jaguar Warrior, the highest rank of warrior in the Aztec army, wielding a wooden club studded with obsidian sharp shards. The Jaguar Warrior is thus a heavy infantry unit which is strong against other infantry units. Their Castle Age unique technology, Atlatl, represents a tool employed by hunters and Warriors that was used for throwing spears or javelins. Their Imperial Age unique technology, Garland Wars, references the "flower wars" which the Aztecs organized among their allies in order to provide more sacrifices. The Aztecs were also known as a hard working and innovative civilization, and their Villagers carry more resources. Being a highly military civilization, the Aztecs also have a general creation speed bonus across the board for all their military units. They were famous for their bloody and ardent faith, with their Relics generating extra gold and their Monks receiving extra HP per each Monastery technology researched, allowing their Monks to join other soldiers on the battlefield. The Aztecs did not have horses or gunpowder. Thus, they completely lack Stables (and with it the entire cavalry branch) and cannons. Also, they start random map games with an Eagle Scout as a scouting unit instead of a Scout Cavalry.</p>

                <p>The Huns are an Eastern European civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They are based on the Hunnic Empire controlled by Attila the Hun. They focus on cavalry.</p>
                <p>Historically, the Huns were a civilization with no discernible origin besides the steppes of Central Asia that was most active in Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages. They are one of the few civilizations that invaded Eastern Europe and displaced many other "barbarian" tribes which caused the Roman Empire to crumble. As a result, their unique unit is the Tarkan, a medium cavalryman armed with a torch that deals high damage to buildings. The most ferocious and courageous Hun warriors were the Tarkans, and they exemplify the Huns as horse riders who raid and pillage buildings. The Huns were known for their irreverence towards artifacts and works of art as well as architectural Wonders were no exception. The destruction of Rome brought by the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarian tribes would later create the term vandalism to describe any senseless destruction, particularly the barbarian defacing of artwork. Their Imperial Age unique technology, Atheism, is a representation of that concept, forcing Wonder and Relic victories to take longer and reducing the cost of the Spies/Treason technology. Being nomads, the Huns have no need for Houses and are only restricted in building units by their resources. The Huns were among the many horse civilizations of Central Asia, and their primacy in battle was because of their horses so their Stables produce units faster. To emulate the fact that their principal fighting force were horse mounted archers, Huns also get cheaper Cavalry Archers. In spite of being nomads, the Huns were skilled in siege warfare, having laid siege to several cities in France, and thus have more accurate Trebuchets.</p>

                <p>The Koreans are an East Asian civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They focus on towers and navy.</p>
                <p>The Korean civilization is based on Korea during the Joseon Dynasty, which was a dynastic kingdom on the Korean Peninsula that lasted for five centuries. Like their predecessors, they are descendants of the Choson civilization, which inhabited the same peninsula. They are a defensive civilization using towers. Also, they utilize a variety of ranged units such as War Wagons, Onagers, and Turtle Ships at sea. One of their most recognized innovations was the Hwacha which fires a series of small bolt like rockets. This is represented by a Mangonel with higher range granted by their unique technology. Being able to successfully defend themselves despite the numerical disadvantages, they are a defensive civilization with a focus on ranged units. As a result of their innovation and knowledge of gunpowder (which originated in China, though the Koreans had to develop it separately since the Chinese kept their technologies a closely guarded secret) the Koreans are one of the few civilizations that have two unique units. The Castle-based unique unit is the War Wagon, a horse-drawn carriage that is essentially a heavily armored cavalry archer. The Dock-based unique unit is the Turtle Ship, an armored and spiked ship which is a heavily armored, short-range artillery ship that is effective against Fire Ships and Demolition Ships. The Koreans were also fine stone workers, especially in crafting sculptures and pottery whose highly prized ceramic coated celadon glaze was the finest in the world. To reflect their stone artisanship and defensive capabilities, their Villagers mine stone faster. Finally, to keep in touch with their defensive theme, their towers are automatically upgraded.</p>

                <p>The Mayans are a Native American civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They focus on archers.</p>
                <p>The Mayans specialize in foot archers and have a robust economy. Situated in Central America, they were best known for their mysterious disappearance around 900 and their ability to build a great civilization in a tropical rainforest climate. The Mayans were resourceful and were able to utilize a variety of natural resources. Examples include limestone for construction, the obsidian for tools and weapons, jade and quetzal feathers used in the elaborate costumes of Maya nobility as well as marine shells, which were used as trumpets. To reflect this achievement, their resources last longer while their unique technologies El Dorado and Obsidian Arrows boost their Eagle Warriors and Archer line. The main force of the Mayan army was archers, and they used them extensively. As a result, their unique unit is the Plumed Archer, a fast archer with a small attack bonus against infantry as well as featuring superior armor and hit points.</p>

                <p>The Spanish are a Western European civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They focus on gunpowder units and Monks.</p>
                <p>The Spanish were best known for exploring much of the world across the Atlantic and for being among the first Europeans to establish colonies along the Caribbean and the Americas. They were also known for defeating powerful Amerindian empires of the New World and introducing Christianity to the region as a result of their powerful navy and superior weaponry. To reflect this achievement, Spanish gunpowder units fire faster and their Cannon Galleons fire more accurately with a Ballistics-like effect and also, their cannonballs travel faster. Their superior weaponry and metallurgy is represented by the fact that their Blacksmith technologies require no gold to be researched. In addition, they can train more than one unique unit, namely the Conquistador and the Missionary which are both mounted units.</p>
                <p>To reflect their widespread religious activity in the Americas, Inquisition allows their Monks and Missionaries to convert faster. As another result of their overseas conquest and their successful search for riches, the Spanish team bonus increases productivity of all allied trade units.</p>

                <p>The Incas are a Native American civilization introduced in Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten. They focus on infantry.</p>
                <p>The Incas were best known for establishing the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. The administrative, political, and military center of the empire was located in Cuzco in modern-day Peru whose framework constituted of officials or Kamayuks who kept important records by utilizing a quipu messenger system rather than a formal writing system. These officials also controlled the Incan army which were a collection of the numerous ethnicities they conquered. Much of their army constituted of peasants and farmers which can be conscripted into battle at any time, and to mirror this, their Villagers benefit from Blacksmith upgrades.</p>
                <p>The Incas referred to their empire as the Tawantinsuyu which can be translated as "The Four Regions" or "The Four United Provinces". To reflect this achievement, the Incas can train more than one unique unit, namely, the Kamayuk, an anti-cavalry infantry which can attack over other units thanks to their long spears, and the Slinger, anti-infantry stone thrower. Their Castle Age unique technology eliminates their Skirmishers and Slingers' minimum range, referring to the Incas' effective use of slings in combat.</p>
                <p>The Incas were also known for their architecture. They did not use mortar, yet their buildings are resilient to earthquakes. To reflect this and their strength in stone working, their buildings consume fewer stone and their Houses support more population. The Incas are also known for their sophisticated farming system which makes extensive use of terracing techniques, and as the result, their team bonus makes Farms build faster.</p>

                <p>The Indians are a South Asian civilization introduced in Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten. They are based on Medieval and Mughal India situated on the Indian subcontinent. They focus Camels and gunpowder units.</p>
                <p>India is one of the world's most ancient civilizations that has existed for millennia, and Medieval India was also influenced by the introduction of Islam. Indian armies historically depended on elephants, so to depict this, they have the Elephant Archer as a unique unit. The northern part of Medieval India also introduced camels as a vital part of their military force, so they also have a unique upgrade to the Heavy Camel, the Imperial Camel, while their team bonus also provides Camels with an attack bonus against buildings, and their own Camels also have more armor. India in the Middle Ages was a highly advanced civilization that learned the secrets of gunpowder from the Chinese and the Saracens, so to reflect this, their Hand Cannoneers are stronger than other civilizations' because of their Imperial unique technology, Shatagni, which increases their range by one. Indian kingdoms were very wealthy and their Castle Age unique technology, Sultans, reflects this by increasing all their gold income by 10%, including Relics and trade income. Fishing was an important part of the Indian economy, so their Fishermen work faster and carry more food. Thanks to their steady population growth over the centuries, Indian Villagers get cheaper as the civilization advances through the Ages.</p>

                <p>The Italians are based on the medieval states in modern-day Italy, such as Venice, Genoa, Florence, and the Papal States. The Italians' unique unit, the Genoese Crossbowman, is an anti-cavalry archer. Their second unique unit, the Condottiero, is an anti-gunpowder infantry. Situated in southern Europe in modern-day Italy, the Italians were a prime center for European trade due to their strategic location of key port cities, in the game their Fishing Ships are 20% cheaper. As a result, Italian cities became one of the wealthiest in the world during that time. To reflect their economic productivity, the Italians feature cheaper trade units, as well as cheaper upgrades from the Dock. The Italians were best known for being a center of culture and knowledge at the city of Florence during the Renaissance which revolutionized the way Europeans think. This made them ahead of other European kingdoms at that time as a result of trading with the more advanced Islamic and Far Eastern kingdoms, therefore the Italians can advance through the Ages at a lower cost. To represent the technological benefits of the Silk Road, Italians' gunpowder units cost less.</p>
                <p>The Italians are one of the people that are cultural descendants of the Roman civilization. The other ones are the Spanish, Portuguese, and the French, that all have also Roman origins, because all these civilizations speak Romance Languages.</p>

The Magyars were also skilled at using bows while riding which is reflected by their unique technology, Recurve Bow, which increases the range and attack of their Cavalry Archers.</p>
                <p>Living as nomadic people was dangerous because when entering the new land, the migrating people had to prepare against any obstacles they may encounter, including wild animals. Thus, Magyar Villagers can kill aggressive wild animals in just one strike. Nomadic people often possess excellent skill at using bow and arrow, because they were necessary for hunting and self-defense which is why the Magyar team bonus increases the Line of Sight of all foot archers.</p>
                <p>The Magyar cavalry often lent their military service to various rulers in Europe. This is reflected by their other unique technology, Mercenaries, which removes the gold cost from their unique unit. Finally, the Magyar cavalry's favored tactic was unleashing a volley of arrows before charging toward the enemy. To reflect their skillful ability at close combat, the Magyars receive free melee attack upgrades at the Blacksmith.</p>

                <p>The Slavs are an Eastern European civilization introduced in Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten. They focus on infantry and siege weapons.</p>
                <p>The Slavs represent their namesake based on the Eastern European peoples that later became the founders of Slavic European nations such as modern Poland, Russia, and Ukraine. By the time frame of Ages of Empires II , the Slavic tribes had already split into the Western, Eastern, and Southern branches.</p>
                <p>The Slavic civilization is mostly representative of the Eastern Slavic identity of the Kievan Rus', whose semi-autonomous principalities and city-states covered much of modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, and Western Russia. Politics of the time were dominated by Boyar aristocracy, which was adapted into the Slavs' unique heavy cavalry unit.</p>
                <p>Educated by the Byzantine Greeks, they adopted the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity as their religion, and to depict this, their unique technology gives Monks extra armor. Slavic armies are mainly composed of infantry, and to depict this, their other unique technology gives infantry trample damage, making them powerful in groups and against clusters of units, and they also receive Tracking for free.</p>
                <p>Slavic lands in modern-day Ukraine were especially fertile and productive, later to be known as the Breadbasket of Europe, thus Slav Farmers receive a bonus. The Slavs were highly influenced by the Byzantines and learned many techniques and technologies from them such as siege engines and military logistics, and to depict this, they have cheaper siege weapons and their team bonus makes military buildings provide +5 population.</p>

                <p>The Berbers are a North African civilization featured in Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms. They focus on navy and cavalry.</p>
                <p>Berber ( Imazighen ) states have existed in North Africa since antiquity, existing alongside Romans, Vandals, and Egyptians in the region; the Berbers were also early converts to Islam, and quickly became one of the most prominent ethnicities in the Early Islamic world, alongside Arabs and Persians. In 711 AD, a coalition of Arab and Berber soldiers invaded Spain and established a kingdom that would endure for centuries and make lasting contributions to art, science, and philosophy. They were dreaded in war because of their fast horses and skilled guerrilla warriors. These facts are reflected in the game in their unique units, both of which are powerful counter units, the Camel Archer and the Genitour, two cavalry units that historically used to be very effective against European armies.</p>
                <p>Much of their strength was represented in the fact that once they built a base they realized systems of communication in order to connect the camps to each other and respond quickly to the attacks of the enemies. To reflect that, their first unique technology, Kasbah, makes their Castles and the allies' ones produce units and research technologies at a faster rate. Because of moving constantly in the desert, their soldiers were used to fight effectively in hostile conditions or as nomads. While Europeans' cavalry could not survive long there, their troops were deadly ambushers able to hit hard and quick. That is why their second unique technology, Maghrabi Camels, gives their camel units a regeneration ability and also, their Villagers move faster. At last, as a result of their sailing abilities, their ships are faster.</p>

                <p>The Ethiopians are an African civilization introduced Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms. They focus on archers and siege weapons.</p>
                <p>The Ethiopians were historically known for the Aksumite and Zagwe kingdoms, which were dedicated followers of Orthodox Christianity and Judaism. Their architecture was the best in the region, and many stelae and other tall monuments exist to this day. For most of the Middle Ages, Ethiopian kingdoms were defensive - not offensive - powers. They protected their lands from various outsiders (Himyarite, Arab, Portuguese, among others), and kept close watch of movements in their own region. To highlight this, the Ethiopian team bonus grants extra Line of Sight for towers and Outposts.</p>
                <p>Ethiopian kingdoms were positioned in a vital area - on the Horn of Africa at the narrow entrance to the Red Sea. This made Aksum a vital center for trade on the Indian Ocean; goods and materials from Europe, India, Arabia, and even China went through Ethiopian ports. Through the ages, they benefited from a regular influx of resources from outside the empire. This is represented in-game with the Ethiopians gaining 100<span>food</span>and 100<span>gold</span>for free whenever they advance an Age.</p>
                <p>The Ethiopians were known to be mercenaries for fast deployments to other kingdoms (particularly Egypt) and were known to be very fierce in battle, but underequipped. To highlight the Ethiopian army, the Shotel Warrior, a powerful but fragile infantry unit, can be created quickly in the Castle. Because historically, spears and polearms were a staple of most Ethiopian armies, the Ethiopians get the Pikemen upgrade at no cost.</p>
                <p>Along with spears and shotel swords, the bow and arrow were important weapons in Ethiopia, and archers formed the backbone of the kingdom's army. Arabs referred to East African archers as Archers of the Eyes to reflect their expert marksmanship, letting loose showers of arrows aimed at the eyes of their enemies. To reflect these facts, Ethiopian archers fire +15% faster.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Ethiopians are one of the few civilizations to have preserved some of the lost technology from the Classical Age after the barbarians destroyed the Roman Empire. They were also exposed through trade to many forms of technology from all over the world. To highlight this, the Ethiopians are the only civilization to access all siege weapons, and have a technology that increases the blast radius for their siege weapons.</p>

                <p>Historically, the Malians were known for their very progressive society that put emphasis on education; it was one of the largest educational centers in the world that brought scholars from China, the Middle East, and Europe. To highlight this achievement, their team bonus increases the research speed for University technologies.</p>
                <p>West African cultures (especially the Dahomey Kingdom) held women in high esteem, with local women even participating in the military. This is highlighted with their unique unit, the Gbeto, which is noted as the only trainable female military unit. In real history, Gbetos or Dahomey Amazons were usually equipped with rifles. Although in-game Gbetos do ont use rifles as their weapons, the Malians have access to various gunpowder units.</p>
                <p>The Mali and Songhai empires were known to be some of the wealthiest kingdoms in Africa; this was primarily due to the enormous natural wealth at their disposal from gold and salt mines, as well as their effective control of the trans-Saharan trade routes that carried valuable resources to and from the region. To reflect this, the Malians gain Gain Mining for free.</p>
                <p>West Africa and the Sahel have sparse vegetation, with few trees. These limited resources meant that the Malians did not have as much of a reliance on lumber in their architecture (instead primarily utilizing clay and mud bricks). This is represented in-game with a -15% wood cost for all Malian buildings. Famous examples of this architectural style include the University of Sankore and the Great Mosque of Djenne (the Malian Wonder).</p>
                <p>Horses played an important role on Western African cultures for centuries, with the Malians known for their tactical use in combat; while Malian cavalry was not as well equipped as their European counterparts, their effective leadership and raiding tactics made them a force to be reckoned with. This is represented in-game with Farimba which gives their Stable units +5 attack. In history, Farimba was a title for the military nobility of the empire, which commanded the cavalry in Malian armies.</p>
                <p>Many foot soldiers in West Africa were fierce in combat, and often won battles with their superior coordination and maneuverability. Therefore, their infantry units from the Barracks gain additional pierce armor.</p>

                <p>The Portuguese are a European civilization introduced in Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms. They focus on navy and gunpowder units.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese are a naval civilization that focuses on solid late-game economy and bases their army strength in versatile gunpowder units and a powerful navy. Historically, Goths first and Arabic people after ruled the Iberic Peninsula before the Reconquista, which caused Portugal to become an independent kingdom from 1139 onwards and to have its territory fully consolidated by 1248. They have been a non-protagonist country in Europe for around two or three centuries. But from the 15th century, during the Age of Discovery, they were able to build a very powerful and large colonial empire, and for a brief period had the supremacy in the Atlantic Ocean before being outclassed by the Spanish, British, and Dutch Empires.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese established tactical colonial bases in the New World and particularly on the African coasts thanks to their excellent navigation skills and organization. This implied great trade advantages opening them exclusive naval routes to India, Africa, and China, along with a wide control of the oceans. This would have been impossible without a powerful, highly advanced military and large fleet along with emperors who financed and oriented their political economics to create a strong colonial trade empire. All of these facts are reflected in the game by giving the Portuguese two unique units (the Organ Gun and the Caravel), and one of the most effective navies since they get +10% HP for all their ships and Carrack which gives their ships +1/+1 armor. They can also count on more accurate gunpowder units thanks to Arquebus which makes gunpowder units fire accurately at moving targets, and free Cartography from the Dark Age.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese resolved the problem of being a small nation by basing their economy on foreign-opened exchange and production of their colonies. This meant that most of their income came from abroad, and had a critical impact on the employment in primary sectors and focus on military and exploring purposes. As a result, from the Imperial Age, they are the only civilization in the game able to collect resources without employing Villagers thanks to their unique building, the Feitoria.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese were also among the first European countries, along with the Spanish, to successfully colonize South America. This operation boasted, as well as a prolonged serious inflation from the late 16th to early 17th centuries, their economy and made Portugal one of the wealthiest and richest European nations for several decades before their eventual military and commercial decline. The crown was able to finance exploring voyages and pay soldiers handsomely. The flourishing economy of the Portuguese was further stimulated as large trade companies started in risk trade investment, which too gave very high profits. The consequences of all this income is reflected in the reduced gold cost of all units, including military ones.</p>

                <p>The Burmese are a Southeast Asian civilization in Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas. They are based on the Pagan Empire and the later Toungoo Empire and feature as a Monk and elephant civilization.</p>
                <p>The region around Burma is well known for their wide mountain ranges with lush valleys and a vast amount of forests. To reflect on this, the Burmese get free upgrades at the Lumber Camp. Buddhism played a huge role for the Burmese, teaching the importance of humbleness, not valuing any wealth and luxuries. This is highlighted with their cheaper Monastery technologies as well as their team bonus that reveals the location of Relics on the map.</p>
                <p>The Burmese army were feared horsemen in the region that were able to hold off on their own against the Mongol invasion for a while despite their eventual defeat. More particularly, the Burmese were known for their traditional horseback dart throwing, which is reflected on their unique unit, the Arambai, and one of their unique technologies, Manipur Cavalry.</p>
                <p>The Burmese were also known for their use of heavily armored elephants, which is reflected with their other unique technology, Howdah, giving Battle Elephants extra melee armor and pierce armor. And finally, the Burmese foot soldiers were trained martial artists with martial arts such as the Aka and Bando, which is reflected with their infantry getting extra attack with every Age advancement.</p>

                <p>The capital of the Khmer Empire was Angkor, which is one of the largest pre-industrial cities. At its peak, the city supported one million people. This is reflected by two of their bonuses: Villagers can garrison inside Houses, and they do not need to build certain buildings to unlock other buildings or to advance to the next Ages. Like their Persian and Indian neighbors to the West, the Khmer Empire was known to employ war elephants widely for both tactical and logistical purpose. To reflect this, their Battle Elephants move faster and can be upgraded to deal more damage with the Tusk Swords unique technology.</p>
                <p>Like their Chinese neighbor to the north, the Khmer Empire was also known to employ ballista technology. Consequently, their team bonus increases the range of Scorpions. In addition, Khmer also possess a ballista-carrying unique unit named the Ballista Elephant. Furthermore, the number of missiles fired by both Ballista Elephants and Scorpions can be increased with the Double Crossbow unique technology.</p>

                <p>The Malay are based on various kingdoms on the Malay Archipelago before European conquest, mainly Srivijaya and Majapahit during the reign of Hayam Wuruk.</p>
                <p>Kingdoms on Malay Archipelago were able to field large number of troops because of the archipelago's large population. To reflect this, the Malay have a cheap and rapidly deployed unique unit that allows higher population than usual and a unique technology that enables the Malay to train and thus also easily field Militia-line units without spending gold. Because the Malay Archipelago is strategically located between India and China, it was often visited by people from both regions who introduced new cultures and technologies to the locals. Therefore, the Malay advance to the next Ages much faster than other civilizations.</p>
                <p>Coastal defense is essential for kingdoms located in the region. Thus, Malay Docks and their allies have much longer Line of Sight. Furthermore, the Malay have access to Thalassocracy that gives their Docks the ability to defend themselves. The vast sea provided huge amount of fish which the people skillfully fished. Therefore, the Malay Fish Traps are cheaper and provide unlimited food. The Sumatran forest had large number of wild elephants and they were often tamed by local people to do various tasks. This is reflected by the Malay's ability to train cheaper Battle Elephants.</p>

                <p>The Vietnamese are a Southeast Asian civilization introduced in Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas. They focus on archers.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese are based on various dynasties in Vietnam before the European colonization. Historically, they were known as one of the few nations who successfully repelled the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. This is mostly attributed to the resistance of the Vietnamese army that mostly consisted of peasants and volunteers that were quickly deployed in the battlefield to resist against enemy invasions. To reflect on the Vietnamese peasant army, they get free Conscription. The Vietnamese were also masters of guerilla warfare, using the Vietnamese jungle and cliffs as their advantage for traps and striking their enemies through the shadows of the Vietnamese jungle. Therefore, they have a unique upgrade for the Elite Skirmisher, the Imperial Skirmisher, which is available as a team bonus for Vietnamese allies.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese were known to be skilled in archery, and one of their known bows was made of rattan, a light-weight wood which was historically used to make armors and shields. This is why the Vietnamese gain extra HP for their Archery Range units and their unique unit, the Rattan Archer is an archer with high pierce armor. The Vietnamese were also known to breed elephants that were larger than most other elephants in the region, and deploy them in battle, which is why their unique technology gives extra HP to their Battle Elephants.</p>
                <p>Even though the Vietnamese have resisted the Ming Dynasty's occupation and overthrew the Ming rulers in Vietnam, China had a strong influence in the region that shaped the Vietnamese culture. To reflect on China's influence, their unique technology, Paper Money, is team-based and grants each Vietnamese ally gold. Finally, the Vietnamese relied on peasant spies and infiltrators to locate enemy camps in order to setup surprise ambushes in the enemy camps which is why enemy Town Centers are revealed in the start of the game.</p>
