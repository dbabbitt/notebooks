List names of any notable people who influenced the scientist significantly. Influences should be restricted to a small number, i.e. two or three, where the scientist was clearly and directly building on the work of a predecessor (for example, the scientist may have identified a predecessor as providing the foundation for one of their major achievements). Unless the scientist was clearly building on an earlier work, avoid adding influences that were only via study, as such influences are generally too many and hard to separate. Only list influences who are notable enough to warrant their own wiki article.

If a field does not apply, leave it blank. Do not delete it. This is because is acts as a place-holder and future editors may find a field applies after all. You may put a comment in the blank field that it is not applicable if you are sure of this.
