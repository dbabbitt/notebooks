I Scraped the Memetic Tribes Google Spreadsheet for the Combatants Graph [OC]

I used pandas.read_html (to read the Google Spreadsheet from its URL), matplotlib, Gephi, and networkx in a Jupyter notebook. I had to use Gimp to put a white background on the image I uploaded to imgur. The red edges are mutual combatants. The placement of the nodes was merely so that labels don't appear near other labels and nodes don't cover edges.

If someone could give me vertical/horizontal political-compass-style coordinates for each memetic tribe, that would be a useful start. As an example, for #MeToo, I can neither find coordinates for the movement, not its chieftains (searching on Google Images for "metoo political compass", et al).
