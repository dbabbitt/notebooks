    "Choosing Colormaps in Matplotlib\n",
    "********************************\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib has a number of built-in colormaps accessible via\n",
    "`.matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`.  There are also external libraries like\n",
    "[palettable]_ and [colorcet]_ that have many extra colormaps.\n",
    "Here we briefly discuss how to choose between the many options.  For\n",
    "help on creating your own colormaps, see\n",
    ":doc:`/tutorials/colors/colormap-manipulation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "========\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind choosing a good colormap is to find a good representation in 3D\n",
    "colorspace for your data set. The best colormap for any given data set depends\n",
    "on many things including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether representing form or metric data ([Ware]_)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your knowledge of the data set (*e.g.*, is there a critical value\n",
    "  from which the other values deviate?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there is an intuitive color scheme for the parameter you are plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there is a standard in the field the audience may be expecting\n",
    "\n",
    "For many applications, a perceptually uniform colormap is the best\n",
    "choice --- one in which equal steps in data are perceived as equal\n",
    "steps in the color space. Researchers have found that the human brain\n",
    "perceives changes in the lightness parameter as changes in the data\n",
    "much better than, for example, changes in hue. Therefore, colormaps\n",
    "which have monotonically increasing lightness through the colormap\n",
    "will be better interpreted by the viewer. A wonderful example of\n",
    "perceptually uniform colormaps is [colorcet]_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color can be represented in 3D space in various ways. One way to represent color\n",
    "is using CIELAB. In CIELAB, color space is represented by lightness,\n",
    "$L^*$; red-green, $a^*$; and yellow-blue, $b^*$. The lightness\n",
    "parameter $L^*$ can then be used to learn more about how the matplotlib\n",
    "colormaps will be perceived by viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An excellent starting resource for learning about human perception of colormaps\n",
    "is from [IBM]_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes of colormaps\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Colormaps are often split into several categories based on their function (see,\n",
    "*e.g.*, [Moreland]_):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential: change in lightness and often saturation of color\n",
    "   incrementally, often using a single hue; should be used for\n",
    "   representing information that has ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Diverging: change in lightness and possibly saturation of two\n",
    "   different colors that meet in the middle at an unsaturated color;\n",
    "   should be used when the information being plotted has a critical\n",
    "   middle value, such as topography or when the data deviates around\n",
    "   zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cyclic: change in lightness of two different colors that meet in\n",
    "   the middle and beginning/end at an unsaturated color; should be\n",
    "   used for values that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase\n",
    "   angle, wind direction, or time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Qualitative: often are miscellaneous colors; should be used to\n",
    "   represent information which does not have ordering or\n",
    "   relationships.\n"
